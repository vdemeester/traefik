## Contributions Daily Meeting

* 3 Maintainers should attend to a Contributions Daily Meeting where we sort and label new issues ([is:issue label:status/0-needs-triage](https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Astatus%2F0-needs-triage+)), and review every Pull Requests
* Every pull request should be checked during the Contributions Daily Meeting
   * Even if it’s already assigned
   * Even PR labelled with `contributor/waiting-for-corrections` or `contributor/waiting-for-feedback`
* Issues labeled with `priority/P0` and `priority/P1` should be assigned.
* Modifying an issue or a pull request (labels, assignees, milestone) is only possible:
   * During the Contributions Daily Meeting
   * By an assigned maintainer
   * In case of emergency, if a change proposal is approved by 2 other maintainers (on Slack, Discord, etc)

## PR review process:

* The status `needs-design-review` is only used in complex/heavy/tricky PRs.
* From `status/1-needs-design-review` to `status/2-needs-review`: 1 design LGTM in comment, by a senior maintainer, if needed.
* From `status/2-needs-review` to `status/3-needs-merge`: 3 LGTM by any maintainer.
* If needed, a specific maintainer familiar with a particular domain can be requested for the review.
* If a PR has been implemented in pair programming, one peer's LGTM goes into the review for free
* Amending someone else's pull request is authorized only in emergency, if a rebase is needed, or if the initial contributor is silent

We use [PRM](https://github.com/ldez/prm) to manage locally pull requests.


## Bots

### [Myrmica Lobicornis](https://github.com/containous/lobicornis/)

**Update and Merge Pull Request**

The maintainer giving the final LGTM must add the `status/3-needs-merge` label to trigger the merge bot.

By default, a squash-rebase merge will be carried out.
If you want to preserve commits you must add `bot/merge-method-rebase` before `status/3-needs-merge`.

The status `status/4-merge-in-progress` is only for the bot.

If the bot is not able to perform the merge, the label `bot/need-human-merge` is added.  
In this case you must solve conflicts/CI/... and after you only need to remove `bot/need-human-merge`.

A maintainer can add `bot/no-merge` on a PR if he want (temporarily) prevent a merge by the bot.

`bot/light-review` can be used to decrease required LGTM from 3 to 1 when:

- vendor updates from previously reviewed PRs
- merges branches into master
- prepare release
